Reflections Styling Elements: I was able to style the page, to make the navigation menu with a humburger button that show the contents that were initially hidden o the small mobile screen, which closely resembles the objective.

 Mastery Areas: The incoporation of CSS, HTML, Tailwind and javascript to achieve the task given.

Challenges Faced: I struggled with the dividers of the component 1, as well as making the hamburger responsive.

Areas for Improvement: I still need to get comfortable with tailwind, the syntax and using it in HTML. 

Code Optimization: I think I have achieved the objective, I need to improve readibility and understanding

Creative Design Choices: I think I have adhered to the components objectives, I would like to use the skills and experience to build more responsive pages, also work on personal projects. images.

Overall Learning Experience I have enjoyed building the landing pages, the skills, the new experience, observing each component coming together was really nice to observe.
